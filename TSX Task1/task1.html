    </p>
    <p class="description"> Hello! My name is Priyanka, and I’m a passionate and dedicated 2nd-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). As a curious learner with a growing interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I love exploring how technology can be used to solve real-world problems.
        Currently serving as the Class Representative (CR) of Section 26, I actively take initiative in academic coordination and team leadership. I enjoy working on creative and technical projects—like building websites and smart chatbots—while continuously learning new concepts in data structures, algorithms, and full-stack development.
        believe in consistent growth, team collaboration, and using tech for a meaningful impact.
I have a solid understanding of topics like CPU scheduling, recurrence relations, and front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m a quick learner, problem-solver, and passionate about applying my skills to real-world challenges.</p>
